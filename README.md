# Slider Quiz

## An interactive horizontal slider quiz built with JavaScript and GSAP animation.

Slider quiz is a replica of an interactive advertisement which was created to increase ad engagement by prompting users with a quiz question. When the user makes a selection, the slider handle moves to the selected answer. If the answer is correct, the handle remains static, if incorrect, the handle moves to the correct answer and the results are displayed in a text. There is a RESET button you can press to reset the slider back to the initial state and answer the question again.

## The problem it solves

This project was created in order to build captivating advertisements for clients such as Netflix, EE, Monzo, British Airways, Bumble, and more. It helped the company deliver highly engaging and visually appealing ad campaigns that effectively captured audience attention and drove user interaction.

## User instructions

When the page loads wait for the instruction animation to finish before interacting with the slider. Pick your answer by dragging the slider handle. The correct answer is displayed underneath, however you do have the option to RESET the slider back to initial and try again.

## Developer instructions

```sh
git clone https://laura-dumitru.github.io/slider-quiz/

Since this is an example project I would encourage you to clone and rename it so that you can use it for your own purposes.
